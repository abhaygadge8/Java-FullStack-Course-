Key Mathematical Concepts:

    Optimal Sphere in Cube:

        The largest sphere that fits inside a cube will have a diameter equal to the cube's side length

        Therefore, the optimal radius = cube side length / 2

    Volume Calculations:

        Sphere volume: V = (4/3)πr³

        Cube volume: V = side³

    Volume Ratio:

        The maximum possible ratio of sphere volume to cube volume is π/6 ≈ 0.5236 (52.36%)
