Key Points:
		
	There are two main configurations for an equilateral triangle in a square:

	The maximum side length occurs in the vertex-aligned configuration and is given by:
		
		s = a * (2√6 - 2√2) ≈ a * 1.035276
	
	The maximum side length is approximately 1.035 times the square's side length

    	The optimal configuration has:

        One vertex at a corner of the square

        The opposite side touching the adjacent sides of the square

    The height of the triangle equals the side length of the square
